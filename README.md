This guide walks you through creating a simple web application that allows users to manage a list of items. Users can:

Add new items to a list.
Delete individual items from the list.
Cancel or clear the input field without adding anything.
The project includes three main components:

HTML: Structures the content of the web page.
CSS: Styles the appearance of the page.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the page.
